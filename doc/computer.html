    <h1>Computer</h1>
    <p>
      A <b>computer</b> is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics"
        >digital electronic</a
      >
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine">machine</a> that can be
      programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations
      (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of
      operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a
      wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that
      includes the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware">hardware</a> ,
      operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used
      for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers
      that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or
      computer cluster. A broad range of industrial and consumer products use
      computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like
      microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices
      like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as
      general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like
      smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other
      computers and users. Early computers were meant to be used only for
      calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people
      in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial
      Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious
      tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical
      machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.
      The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during
      World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were
      followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_integrated_circuit"
        >monolithic integrated circuit</a
      >
      (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor
      and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and
      versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since
      then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by
      Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to
      early 21st centuries.
